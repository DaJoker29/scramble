# Scramble

Word Scramble Game

# Build Instruction

1. Install - `npm install`
2. Build - `grunt dev` or `grunt prod`
3. Enjoy

*Note: You can run `grunt` to launch development build and watch server to start coding!*

## TODO

1. Change Module names (scramble -> Scramble, game -> Game)
2. **DOCUMENTATION!!!!**
2. `Highlight Answers` button -> Checkbox
3. `Score Multiplier` should be it's own well (BIG TEXT)
4. Answer field background color should change instead of it's well.
5. Tooltips (or modal) with information about the various settings and fields.
6. Find more words to add to the dictionary (maybe pull from an online API)
7. Add a more challenging point-reducing setting (Multiplier keeps going below 0. Negative multipliers subtract that amount from your current score.)
