## TODO

- [x] Change Module names (scramble -> Scramble, game -> Game)
- [x] **DOCUMENTATION!!!!**
- [x] Tooltips (or modal) with information about the various settings and fields.
- [ ] Find more words to add to the dictionary (maybe pull from an online API)
- [ ] Add a more challenging point-reducing setting (Multiplier keeps going below 0. Negative multipliers subtract that amount from your current score.)
